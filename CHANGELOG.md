## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Improved stabilizer decomposition strategies. When compiling a sampler, you can now choose between three different strategies: `"cat5"`, `"bss"`, and `"cutting"`. The default is `"cat5"` and applies to T and arbitrary rotations; see [arxiv.org/abs/2106.07740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07740) (#77)
- Sparse geometric channel sampler for noise modeling based on [this repo](https://github.com/kh428/accel-cutting-magic-state/tree/main). This significantly improves performance when the stabilizer rank is low. (#64)
- `Circuit.append` method for programmatic circuit construction (#65)
- `Circuit.is_clifford` property and automatic replacement of U3 gates with Clifford equivalents for pi/2 rotations (#69)
- Improved `pyzx` visualization. Now *doubled ZX notation* is used when using the `"pyzx"` argument in `Circuit.diagram`, which is a technically accurate depiction of the quantum circuit (#86)
- Automatic batch size selection based on available memory (#84)

### Changed

- Tsim now uses `pyzx-param==0.9.3` which fixes a bug where diagrams were not fully reduced in the absence of noise
- Tsim will now make sure that marginal probabilities are normalized and raise an error if they are not. Wrong normalization can be the result of rare underflow errors that will be addressed in a future release (#87)
- Use BLAS matmul kernel for tensor contractions (#63)
- Circuit flattening deferred to ZX graph construction time (#71)
- White background for SVG plots, which are now readable in dark mode (#85)
